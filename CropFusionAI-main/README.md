## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to use AI and open source technology to help poor farmers in India grow the best crops and fertilize like a pro. Our tool provides reliable and accessible recommendations based on local soil and weather conditions, helping farmers optimize their crop yields and improve their economic livelihoods.
